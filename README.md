- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Chrisostomos-Stamou, I am doing my Masters' in Physics and I am specialized in Cosmology
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in investigating the nature of Dark Energy that is dominating the Universe, both observationally and theoretically.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on ways to improve cosmic shear measurements, which is a powerful probe for placing constraints on Cosmology
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email: cstammc@gmail.com , or my institutional account: c.p.stamou@umail.leidenuniv.nl

NEAR FUTURE: 

1) I will create a public repository, containing calculations of shear correlation functions by using TreeCorr. These calculations were done as a part of an MSc project.

2) I will soon create a personal website, where more information will be available.
