- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Chrisostomos-Stamou, I am doing my Masters' in Physics and I am specialized in Cosmology
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in investigating the nature of Dark Energy that is dominating the Universe, both observationally and theoretically.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on ways to improve cosmic shear measurements, which is a powerful probe for placing constraints on Cosmology
